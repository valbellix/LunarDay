# LunarDay
A simple Python script to calculate the days after the last new Moon.

This script leverages on the *Epact* that is a method used by old people to calculate the Moon day. 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epact) is a good source of information if you want to learn more about it.

## Why did people use such a thing?
There are a lots of believes that used to be common knowledge until the latest decades of the XXth century, especially for what concerns farming. Some of these believes are still widely known especially for what concerns wine production and lumberjacking.

## Origins
This method to calculate the Moon day comes from ancient Greeks and Romans. The algorithm to calculate the days after the last new Moon is mostly the same used 2500 years ago. Once it was common knowledge in Italy, but this knowledge is now fading. Since it has been used for 2500 years, I think it deserves to be remembered.
